[What Self Driving Cars Tell Us About AI Risks](https://spectrum.ieee.org/self-driving-cars-2662494269)


"AI cannot cope with lack of information" And therefore phantom breaking happens and a larger number of rear end accidents come from self driving cars.

In the process of training an llm, images are connected to a label contined in a database. But in reality, not every possibility can be modeled, and therefore hard to predict what will fail.


### Comments

Shriya Kalakata (shriyakalakata): 

The author argues that while AI promises benefits, it also comes with risks due to issues like software errors and unpredictable failures. It's interesting because the author doesn't call for banning AI altogether but rather argues for building expertise within regulatory agencies. This seems like a reasonable approach to me. Restricting technology too much can limit potential benefits, but having no oversight at all is also risky. We need thoughtful policies grounded in an understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations.
